/* Events in each calendar indexed by month.

 * added with a special "yyyymm" value of 0.
 *
 * Any entries identified by a lookup on this table may already be deleted, moved to the trash (see "Event.trashTime")
 * or have been updated (i.e. "EventsByMonth.eTag" != "Event.eTag"). Also, any identified recurring events might have
 * exceptions. Therefore, further processing of any identified events will be necessary. Any stale indices will be
 * deleted as they are found.
 *

 *     - When performing any lookup, this query will also have to be executed to identify any infinitely recurring
 *       events. These must then be expanded to determine if they recur during the requested time period.
